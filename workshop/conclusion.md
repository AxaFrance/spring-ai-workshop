# Conclusion

Thanks for following this workshop !

We hope you enjoyed it and learned a lot about LLMs and how to interact with them using Spring AI.
This workshop is an introduction, and we focused on Spring AI chat completion features.

Here are many features and possibilities about LLMs and Spring AI that we didn't cover.
